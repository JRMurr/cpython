# CPython Zig Package

This is a fork of [CPython](https://www.python.org/), packaged for Zig.

Unnecessary files have been deleted, and the build system has been replaced
with `build.zig`. There are no system dependencies; the only thing required to
build this package is [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/).
